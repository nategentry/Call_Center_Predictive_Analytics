# Call_Center_Predictive_Analytics
Using time series analysis to predict future call volume at a call center.

Using data from a fictional case on the "Jennie Maze Limited" student loan call center in Toledo, OH our team used a variety of predictive time series models to forecast monthly call volume using historical data.

When applied to test data we found that a regression that accounted for trend and seasonality and was adjusted monthly using exponential smoothing was more predictive than a Holt-Winters exponential model.

Attached is a detailed brief of our analysis as well as a PowerPoint slideshow summarizing our methodolgy, challenges, and conclusions.
